`waitwhat.sh` is the website you are on right now!

I built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, as a kind of experiment. I'm not sure if I'll ever use it again, but I'm sure it's a great tool for building websites. I don't think I really followed the best practices, but it works very well, and builds in about `9ms`.

I tried to keep the site as minimalistic as possible, and in the process made a design I am really happy with. I may or may not rebuilt it with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in the future if I ever have way too much free time again.
