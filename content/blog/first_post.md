This is the first blog post on my website. Exciting!

## why do i need a blog?
I've always wanted a place to share things. Random things I come up with or find on the internet, things that took me painfully long to find. It would be nice to be able to share them, so that others wouldn't have to suffer like I did.

## it's open source
You can find the [source code](https://github.com/wait-what/personal-site) for the website on Github. It's built using hugo. I tried my best to keep it as simple and minimalistic as possible.

## markdown demonstration
As everyone does, I am going to show off my custom markdown styling.

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3
#### heading 4
##### heading 5

- bullet
- points
- are
- nice!

**this text is bold and also red**

_and this text is italics but it's actually gray_

[this is a blue link that leads nowhere](.)

`this text is monospaced`

```rs
// This is a rust code block
use crate::module::Structure;

fn main() {
    let structure = Structure::new(1u8, 2.);

    loop {
        println!("{:?}", structure);
    }
}
```

> cool blockquote

> and
>> this one
>>> is nested

### lorem ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur **adipiscing** elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut _labore_ et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis `nostrud` exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex **ea commodo consequat**. Duis aute irure dolor in [reprehenderit](.) in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat _nulla pariatur_. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia `deserunt mollit` anim id est laborum.

This concludes the custom markdown styling demonstration.
